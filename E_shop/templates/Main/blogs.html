                                        Design is most effective when executed with knowledge of psychology. Knowing how people react to visual stimuli allows the crafting of an effective design, without psychology, you are guessing. Psychology is a vastly fluctuating and massive subject, but that doesn’t mean you need a Ph.D. to use it in your design. There are simple psychological principles you can use to improve the effectiveness of your design even without knowing the theory behind it.

While there are hundreds of relevant principles, the following ten can be used to improve your designs’ aesthetic quality, usability, and comprehension.

                                            Things don't have to change the world to be important. Technology is nothing. What's important is that you have a faith in people, that they're basically good and smart, and if you give them tools, they'll do wonderful things with them. I've always been attracted to the more revolutionary changes.

                                        You may consider yourself self-aware and in complete control… well I’ve got news for you, you’re not. For centuries cognition has tricked humans into believing their actions are entirely thought-out and preplanned. Modern psychology says otherwise. Much of human behavior is still rooted and influenced by our “old brain,” the part of our mind controlling the survival instincts that kept our ancestors alive (Weinschenk, Nuero Web Design, 2009.) The old brain reacts much faster than conscious thought and is triggered anytime we’re exposed to a representation of food, shelter, danger or reproduction. These are called “visceral reactions” as they originate from the central nervous system (Norman, Emotional Design, 2005.)

                                    <p class="mb-30px">Related to visceral reactions is the cost-benefit principle which surmises behavior is regulated by the perceived difficulty of a task concerning the perceived reward (The Journal of Neuroscience, 8 April 2009, 29(14): 4531-4541.) Basic human behavior can be summed up as opportunity seeking and threat avoidance. For example, your body is hardwired to seek energy-dense food, which is why calorie-dense foods like french fries and chocolate are more challenging to resist than lettuce. Because the fuel for energy (food) used to be scarce and took energy to obtain, we have developed an uncanny drive to conserve energy where possible. Our ancestors survived by limiting their energy usage to activities that would provide high benefits.</p>

                            <p>It only takes a little exploration into cognitive psychology to smash the illusion that we have a firm grasp of the world around us. It seems our brain loves to take shortcuts and make assumptions while reassuring ourselves that everything has been well thought out. The most nefarious of examples are the Gestalt Principles. Developed by german psychologists in the 1920s, the principles describe how our brain assumes unification or relatedness to visuals based on proximity and whitespace. For example, visuals in close proximity are perceived as related when not necessarily the case. Another example is similarity, where elements that look similar are considered related and elements that look different are unrelated  (Humphrey, G. (1924). The psychology of the gestalt. Journal of Educational Psychology.)</p>
